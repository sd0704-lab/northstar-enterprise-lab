# 01 - Scope and Objectives

## 1. Scope Statement
This project includes the design and implementation of a simulated enterprise cybersecurity environment supporting identity management, network security, monitoring, and adversary simulation. The environment will be built using virtualized infrastructure and documented to enterprise standards.

## 2. In Scope
- Proxmox Hypervisor deployment
- pfSense firewall configuration
- Active Directory Domain Services implementation
- Domain-joined Windows workstations
- Wazuh SIEM deployment
- Security Onion network monitoring
- Controlled adversary simulation using Kali Linux

## 3. Out of Scope
- Cloud hybrid integration (Phase 2 consideration)
- Remote access VPN implementation
- High-availability clustering
- Production-grade redundancy
- Regulatory compliance certification

## 4. Objectives
- Deploy functional enterprise-style domain environment
- Implement centralized logging and monitoring
- Establish security baseline configuration
- Develop detection use cases mapped to MITRE ATT&CK
- Fully document infrastructure and security architecture

## 5. Constraints
- Single hypervisor environment
- Residential network limitations
- Academic schedule constraints
- Limited hardware budget

## 6. Assumptions
- Lab represents a mid-sized enterprise model
- Systems operate in an isolated virtual environment
- No exposure to production networks
