## Change Control Summary

* All infrastructure changes remain within the approved project scope.
* VPN deployment was evaluated and reversed to prevent scope expansion and unnecessary exposure.
* Monitoring systems were staged to support future detection engineering objectives.
* Governance documentation (Charter, Scope, Stakeholder Register, WBS) is now complete, establishing a formal project execution baseline.
