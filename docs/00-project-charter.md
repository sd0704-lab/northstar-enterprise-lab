## 00 - Project Charter  
Northstar Precision Manufacturing (NPM) – Enterprise Cyber Defense Lab

## 1. Project Purpose
To design and implement a simulated enterprise cybersecurity infrastructure supporting blue team operations, incident response readiness, and purple team adversary simulation within a controlled lab environment.

## 2. Project Objectives
- Deploy enterprise-style Active Directory environment
- Implement centralized logging and monitoring
- Establish security baseline configuration
- Develop detection use cases mapped to MITRE ATT&CK
- Document all infrastructure, configurations, and change control

## 3. Project Scope
## In Scope:
- Virtualized enterprise network
- Domain service deployment Firewall configuration
- Logging platform (Wazuh/Scurity Onion)
- Detection engineering use case development
## Out of Scope:
- Prtoduction deployment
- Real-world data ingestion
- External internet exposure
- Regulatory compliance certification

## 4. Major Deliverables
- Enterprise network architecture diagram
- Active Directory OU and RBAC design
- Security baseline GPO configuration
- Logging and monitoring deployment
- Detection use case documentation
- Final project report

## 5. Milestones
- Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Deployment
- Phase 2: Security Hardening
- Phase 3: Monitoring & Detection Engineering
- Phase 4: Adversary Simulation & Testing
- Phase 5: Final Documentation & Presentation

## 6. Constraints
- Budget limited to existing hardware
- Timeline aligned with academic schedule
- Lab environment only (no production systems)

## 7. Assumptions
- Virtualization platform remains stable
- Academic access to required software continues
- Simulated enterprise scale suffcient for testing

## 8. Risks (High-Level)
- Hardware failure
- Software misconfiguration
- Time management conflicts
- Resource limitations

## 9. Stakeholders
- Scott Dempsey – Project Lead
- University of Phoenix – Academic Oversight
- Simulated Security Operations Team

## 10. Success Criteria
- Domain services operational
- Logging and monitoring functional
- Security baseline implemented
- MITRE-mapped detection validated
- Full documentation delivered
